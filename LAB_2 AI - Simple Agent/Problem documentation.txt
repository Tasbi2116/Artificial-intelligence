Lab 3. Simple agent
This assignment is a simulation of a real world scenario. The location of each truck would be (x,y)
coordinates {such as (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) and so on}. Test with at least 5x7 dimensions.
Dimensions are not fixed. You must consider some operations (say 5) in a single time step. In a
single time step, the truck will continue to move randomly until it reaches at any last coordinate.
Before each timestep, the locations of the objects should be initialized randomly, except for the
locations in the previous timestep. Move will be random except for the boundary locations. When
the agent reaches a boundary location there would be no move in a step. Measure performance
according to first assignment that I already taught. In the program, you also need to track the
locations of the truck in a separate variable.
Must: When you show your work you to show the followings in paper or pdf (50% marks of the
assignment):
 Theoretical Analysis
 Data structure
 Algorithm to function/method representation
 Implementation
 Input test cases format
 Output format
